2. About~

Vim plugin XkbSwitch can be used to easily switch current keyboard layout back
and forth when entering and leaving Insert mode. Say you are typing some
document in Russian and have to leave Insert mode: when you press <Esc> your
keyboard layout switches to US/English automatically. When you further enter
Insert mode once again the Russian keyboard layout will be automatically
switched back!

XkbSwitch requires OS dependent keyboard layout switcher. Currently it depends
on xkb-switch (http://github.com/ierton/xkb-switch) for UNIX / X Server and
xkb-switch-win (http://github.com/DeXP/xkb-switch-win) for Windows. Mac OS X
keyboard layout switcher is currently unknown and hence not supported.

==============================================================================
                                            *xkbswitch-features*
3. Features~

  - Supported OS: UNIX / X Server, Windows
  - Switches keyboard layout when entering / leaving Insert and Select modes
  - Keyboard layouts are stored separately for each buffer
  - Keyboard layouts are kept intact while navigating between windows or
    tabs without leaving Insert mode
  - Automatic loading of language-friendly Insert mode mappings duplicates.
    For example when Russian mappings have loaded then if there was a mapping
>
    <C-G>S        <Plug>ISurround
<
    a new mapping
>
    <C-G>Ы        <Plug>ISurround
<
    will be loaded. Insert mode mappings duplicates make it easy to apply
    existing maps in Insert mode without switching current keyboard layout.
    See details in |xkb-configure|

==============================================================================
                                            *xkbswitch-setup*
4. Setup~

Before installation of the plugin the OS dependent keyboard layout switcher
must be installed (see |xkbswitch-about|). The plugin itself is installed by
extracting of the distribution in your vim runtime directory.

==============================================================================
                                            *xkbswitch-configure*
5. Configuration~

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            *xkbswitch-conf-basic*
5.1 Basic configuration~

Basic configuration requires only 1 line in your .vimrc:
>
    let g:XkbSwitchEnabled = 1
<
Additionally path to the backend switcher library can be defined:
>
    let g:XkbSwitchLib = '/usr/local/lib/libxkbswitch.so'
<
However normally it is not necessary as far as the plugin is able to find it
automatically. To enable Insert mode mappings duplicates user may want to add
>
    let g:XkbSwitchIMappings = ['ru']
<
Here Insert mappings duplicates for Russian winkeys layout will be generated
whenever Insert mode is started. It is possible to define a list of different
layouts, for example
>
    let g:XkbSwitchIMappings = ['ru', 'de']
<
but currently only Russian winkeys layout translation map ('ru') is supported
out of the box. There are 2 ways how a user can provide extra definitions of
keyboard layout translation maps (or replace existing default 'ru' map):

  - Define variable g:XkbSwitchIMappingsTr:
>
    let g:XkbSwitchIMappingsTr = {
                \ 'ru':
                \ {'<': 'qwertyuiop[]asdfghjkl;''zxcvbnm,.`/'.
                \       'QWERTYUIOP{}ASDFGHJKL:"ZXCVBNM<>?~@#$^&|',
                \  '>': 'йцукенгшщзхъфывапролджэячсмитьбюё.'.
                \       'ЙЦУКЕНГШЩЗХЪФЫВАПРОЛДЖЭЯЧСМИТЬБЮ,Ё"№;:?/'},
                \ 'de':
                \ {'<': 'yz-[];''/YZ{}:"<>?~@#^&*_\',
                \  '>': 'zyßü+öä-ZYÜ*ÖÄ;:_°"§&/(?#'},
                \ }
<
  - Create a file with layout translation maps and put its path into variable
    g:XkbSwitchIMappingsTrData, for example:
>
   let g:XkbSwitchIMappingsTrData = $HOME.'/opt/xkbswitch.tr'
<
    File with maps must follow this format:
>
  ru  Russian winkeys layout
  < qwertyuiop[]asdfghjkl;'zxcvbnm,.`/QWERTYUIOP{}ASDFGHJKL:"ZXCVBNM<>?~@#$^&|
  > йцукенгшщзхъфывапролджэячсмитьбюё.ЙЦУКЕНГШЩЗХЪФЫВАПРОЛДЖЭЯЧСМИТЬБЮ,Ё"№;:?/

  de
  < yz-[];'/YZ{}:"<>?~@#^&*(_\
  > zyßü+öä-ZYÜ*ÖÄ;:_°"§&/()?#
<
    Sample file xkbswitch.tr with exactly this content is shipped with this
    plugin distribution. It is encoded in UTF-8 and it is important as far as
    its content is read using |readfile()|! If your locale is not UTF-8 and
    you want to use this sample file then it seems that you will have to
    re-encode it in your locale standard encoding

Be very careful with mapping duplicates! They won't replace existing Insert
mode mappings but may define extra mappings that will change normal Insert
mode user experience. For example plugin echofunc defines Insert mode mappings
for '(' and ')', therefore assuming that in Deutsch translation map there
could be ')' to '=' translation, we would get '=' unusable in any keyboard
layout (as far as echofunc treats ')' in a very specific way). That is why
this translation is missing in example above and in file xkbswitch.tr content.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            *xkbswitch-default-layouts*
5.2 Default layouts~

By default saved Normal mode keyboard layout is restored when leaving Insert
mode, but you can specify to use particular layout for that:
>
    let g:XkbSwitchNLayout = 'us'
<
Also you can specify original Insert mode keyboard layout:
>
    let g:XkbSwitchILayout = 'us'
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            *xkbswitch-filetype-disable*
5.3 Disable for specific filetypes~

It makes sense to disable XkbSwitch for buffers with specific filetypes, for
example various file system or tag navigators. For example to disable
XkbSwitch for NerdTree add in your .vimrc line
>
    let g:XkbSwitchSkipFt = [ 'nerdtree' ]
<
By default (e.g. when g:XkbSwitchSkipFt is not defined in .vimrc) following
filetypes are skipped: 'tagbar', 'gundo', 'nerdtree' and 'fuf' (FuzzyFinder).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            *xkbswitch-runtime-enable*
5.4 Enable in runtime~

You can enable XkbSwitch in runtime (e.g. when g:XkbSwitchEnabled is not set
in your .vimrc) by issuing command
>
    :EnableXkbSwitch
<
This command will respect current settings of g:XkbSwitchIMappings etc. Be
aware that there is no way to disable XkbSwitch after it has been enabled.

                                            *xkbswitch-plugins*
6. Custom keyboard layout switching rules~

Imagine that you are editing a simple dictionary with 2 columns delimited by
vertical bars. In the first column you are writing down a German word and in
the second column - its Russian translation. For example:
>
 | Wort         | Übersetzung |
 |--------------|-------------|
 | der Mond     | луна        |
 | humpeln      | хромать     |
 | stark        | сильный     |
<
You want the keyboard layout to be automatically switched to the corresponding
language when you are moving between the columns in Insert mode. It is
feasible! When you start editing switch layouts in the both columns manually
just once: after that XkbSwitch will learn how to switch them further. It will
restore layouts after leaving Insert mode and entering it once again.

In this section it will be shown how to achieve this. First of all there
should exist criteria upon which XkbSwitch will decide when it must switch
layouts. The simplest criteria are syntactic rules. So the content of the
columns must be syntactically distinguishable. It means that we need a file
with syntax rules and some new filetype defined, say 'mdict'. For the sake of
simplicity let it be not an absolutely new filetype but rather a subclass of
an existing one, for example vimwiki. Then we should create a new file
after/syntax/vimwiki.vim:
>
 if match(bufname('%'), '\.mdict$') == -1
     finish
 endif

 let s:colors = {'original':   [189, '#d7d7ff'],
               \ 'translated': [194, '#d7ffd7'],
               \ 'extra':      [191, '#d7ff5f']}

 function! s:set_colors()
     let colors = deepcopy(s:colors)
     if exists('g:colors_name') && g:colors_name == 'lucius' &&
                 \ g:lucius_style == 'light'
         let colors['original']   = [26,  '#005fd7']
         let colors['translated'] = [22,  '#005f00']
         let colors['extra']      = [167, '#d75f5f']
     endif
     exe 'hi mdictOriginalHl term=standout ctermfg='.colors['original'][0].
                 \ ' guifg='.colors['original'][1]
     exe 'hi mdictTranslatedHl term=standout ctermfg='.
                 \ colors['translated'][0].' guifg='.colors['translated'][1]
     exe 'hi mdictExtraHl term=standout ctermfg='.colors['extra'][0].
                 \ ' guifg='.colors['extra'][1]
 endfunction

 syntax match mdictOriginal '\%(^\s*|\)\@<=[^|]\+\ze|[^-]'
             \ containedin=VimwikiTableRow contained contains=mdictExtra

 syntax match mdictTranslated '\%([^-]|\)\@<=[^|]\+\ze|$'
             \ containedin=VimwikiTableRow contained contains=mdictExtra

 syntax match mdictExtra '([^()]*)' contained

 call s:set_colors()
 autocmd ColorScheme * call s:set_colors()

 hi link mdictOriginal   mdictOriginalHl
 hi link mdictTranslated mdictTranslatedHl
 hi link mdictExtra      mdictExtraHl
<
Here the syntactic criteria have been defined: content of the first column
will have syntax id 'mdictOriginal' and content of the second column -
'mdictTranslated'.

In .vimrc following lines must be added:
>
 let g:mdict_synroles = ['mdictOriginal', 'mdictTranslated']

 fun! MdictCheckLang(force)
     if !filereadable(g:XkbSwitchLib)
         return
     endif

     let cur_synid  = synIDattr(synID(line("."), col("."), 1), "name")

     if !exists('b:saved_cur_synid')
         let b:saved_cur_synid = cur_synid
     endif
     if !exists('b:saved_cur_layout')
         let b:saved_cur_layout = {}
     endif

     if cur_synid != b:saved_cur_synid || a:force
         let cur_layout = ''
         for role in g:mdict_synroles
             if b:saved_cur_synid == role
                 let cur_layout =
                     \ libcall(g:XkbSwitchLib, 'Xkb_Switch_getXkbLayout', '')
                 let b:saved_cur_layout[role] = cur_layout
                 break
             endif
         endfor
         for role in g:mdict_synroles
             if cur_synid == role
                 if exists('b:saved_cur_layout[role]')
                     call libcall(g:XkbSwitchLib, 'Xkb_Switch_setXkbLayout',
                                 \ b:saved_cur_layout[role])
                 else
                     let b:saved_cur_layout[role] = empty(cur_layout) ?
                                 \ libcall(g:XkbSwitchLib,
                                 \ 'Xkb_Switch_getXkbLayout', '') : cur_layout
                 endif
                 break
             endif
         endfor
         let b:saved_cur_synid = cur_synid
     endif
 endfun

 autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.mdict setlocal filetype=vimwiki |
            \ EnableXkbSwitch
 autocmd BufNewFile         *.mdict VimwikiTable 2 2
 autocmd BufNewFile         *.mdict exe "normal dd" | startinsert

 let g:XkbSwitchPostIEnterAuto = [
             \ [{'pat': '*.mdict', 'cmd': 'call MdictCheckLang(1)'}, 0] ]
<
Function MdictCheckLang() does all the custom layout switching and can be
regarded as a plugin to the XkbSwitch. The first autocommand states that if
file has extension 'mdict' then its filetype must be 'vimwiki' and turns on
XkbSwitch. The next two autocommands are optional and only make editing mdict
files more comfortable. The last autocommand (for CursorMovedI events) calls
MdictCheckLang() when cursor moves into different columns in Insert mode.
The next definition
>
 let g:XkbSwitchPostIEnterAuto = [
             \ [{'pat': '*.mdict', 'cmd': 'call MdictCheckLang(1)'}, 0] ]
<
registers an InsertEnter autocommand in augroup XkbSwitch. If we would have
instead defined an InsertEnter autocommand here then the command would have
been put before the standard InsertEnter autocommand in augroup XkbSwitch.
Using variable g:XkbSwitchPostIEnterAuto ensures that the new command will run
after the standard InsertEnter autocommand. The second element in an item
inside g:XkbSwitchPostIEnterAuto can be 0 or 1. If it is 1 then XkbSwitch
won't switch layout itself when entering Insert mode. In our case it should be
0 because MdictCheckLang() requires preliminary switching keyboard layout from
XkbSwitch when entering Insert mode.

                                            *xkbswitch-issues*
7. Troubleshooting~

  - There is a known issue when vim-latex package is installed. In this case
    entering Russian symbols in Insert mode when editing tex files becomes
    impossible. The issue arises from clashing XkbSwitch Insert mappings
    duplicates with mappings defined in vim-latex. To work this issue around
    you can disable XkbSwitch Insert mode mappings duplicates for filetype
    'tex':
>
    let g:XkbSwitchIMappingsSkipFt = ['tex']
<
  - Related to X Server only. When editing files on a remote host via ssh the
    ssh -X option must be supplied:
>
    ssh -X remote.host
<
    This option will make ssh forward X Server protocol messages between the
    local host and the remote host thus making it possible to switch the local
    host keyboard layouts.

  - Related to GTK based gvim only. In bare X terminals keycodes for <C-S> and
    <C-Ы> are the same which makes it possible to leave sequences with control
    keys in Insert mode mappings duplicates as they are. But this is not the
    case in GTK based gvim. The issue is still investigated.

  - XkbSwitch supports switching via Select mode too. But there is a case when
    switching from Select mode to Normal mode will fail to restore Normal mode
    keyboard layout. This will happen when leaving Select mode without any
    character having been entered. The reason is simple: vim does not generate
    events that could be caught by autocommands when switching from Select
    mode to Normal mode. A workaround could be: when you are leaving Select
    mode without any character entered do it via Visual mode, e.g. enter
    <C-G><Esc> instead simply <Esc>.

                                            *xkbswitch-changes*
A. Change History~

0.1
    - Initial release

0.2
    - Better treatment of Insert mode mapping duplicates

0.3
    - Checking for library presence implemented by filereadable() instead
      executable() - looks like it may have sense for Ubuntu
    - Fixed error messages upon start if g:XkbSwitchEnabled were not set
    - Added doc about command EnableXkbSwitch

0.4
    - Insert mode mappings duplicates factory algorithm reimplemented
    - New global variable g:XkbSwitchIMappingsSkipFt introduced. It is
      supposed to be used to disable Insert mode mappings duplicates creation
      for specific file types
    - Docs updated

0.5
    - Cleaner and more generic algorithm for switching layout when leaving
      Insert mode: there is no default keyboard layout in Normal mode any
      more; instead last layout that was actual when entering Insert mode is
      being restored when leaving Insert mode.
    - Troubleshooting section in the documentation was extended

0.6
    - Added variable g:XkbSwitchPostIEnterAuto to register InsertEnter
      autocommands that should run after standard XkbSwitch InsertEnter
      autocommand
    - Added an example of how custom keyboard layout switching rules inside
      Insert mode can be implemented
    - Fixed Select mode switching broken in version 0.5

0.7
    - Keyboard layouts are kept intact while navigating between windows or
      tabs without leaving Insert mode
    - A new variable g:XkbSwitchSkipFt was introduced to provide ability of
      disabling XkbSwitch for specific filetypes

0.8
    - Added possibility to specify default Normal mode and original Insert
      mode keyboard layouts
    - Docs fixed and extended

0.8.1
    - Fixed a bug when original Insert mode layout could be lost when leaving
      a buffer in Insert mode for a new tab in gvim. Thanks to zdm for code
      contribution. The bug was caused by missing BufLeave events in certain
      cases. It seems that it does not affect all vim flavors (both latest
      Mercurial snapshot built on my Fedora 18 desktop and standard vim
      distribution taken from repository seem to be not affected). You can
      disable the code of the fix by adding in your .vimrc line

        let g:XkbSwitchFixNoBufLeave = 0

      if you know that your vim is good and always generates BufLeave events
      when jumping to another tab while being in Insert mode

0.8.2
    - The cause of the issue explained in the 0.8.1 change log discovered. It
      affects gvim in client-server mode (e.g. when files are open from an
      external application using options --remote-tab and similar). Variable
      g:XkbSwitchFixNoBufLeave is not needed any more: the fix is applied
      automatically in gvim with clientserver feature. Also this issue
      investigation revealed that different switcher strategies implemented
      inside backend libraries must be supported. Currently X server switcher
      gets and sets keyboard layout globally whereas Windows switcher does it
      locally in vim window. This difference is reflected in a new field
      'local' in dictionary g:XkbSwitch
